# Chainsaw Local Project Configuration
# Location: .config.yaml (in project root or subdirectories)
#
# This file allows per-project customization of indexing behavior.
# Only certain fields can be overridden - this is by design for security.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# - Daemon: Discovers this file per-file based on file location
# - CLI: Discovers this file from current working directory
# - Merging: Local settings are ADDITIVE (make filtering more restrictive)

# For CLI: Add additional directories to search
# IMPORTANT: Must be within global include scope for security
include:
  - "./vendor"          # Relative to this .config.yaml file
  - "../shared-lib"     # Can reference parent directories  
  - "./external-deps"   # Project-specific dependencies

# For Both: Add additional directories to exclude from indexing
exclude:
  - "tmp/"              # Temporary files
  - "*.cache"           # Cache directories
  - "build/"            # Build artifacts
  - ".venv/"            # Python virtual environment
  - "coverage/"         # Test coverage reports

# For Both: Add additional file patterns to reject (regex)
blacklist:
  - ".*\\.tmp$"         # Temporary files
  - ".*\\.log$"         # Log files
  - ".*debug.*\\.go$"   # Debug-specific code files

# ❌ CANNOT OVERRIDE:
# - whitelist (global exceptions only)
# - embedding_model, chunk_size, overlap
# - graph_driver settings
# - include (daemon ignores local include)

# EXAMPLES:

# Example 1: Monorepo with external vendor directory
# include:
#   - "./packages"
#   - "./vendor"
# exclude:
#   - "*/node_modules"
#   - "*/dist"

# Example 2: Python project with virtual environment
# exclude:
#   - ".venv/"
#   - "__pycache__"
#   - "*.pyc"
# blacklist:
#   - ".*\\.coverage$"

# Example 3: Go project with generated code
# exclude:
#   - "generated/"
#   - "mocks/"
# blacklist:
#   - ".*\\.pb\\.go$"      # Protobuf generated files
#   - ".*_mock\\.go$"      # Mock files
